Running an Experiment
*********************

Once you are happy with what variables you will record and your experiment
parameters, you can run the experiment. The Run button in the upper bar should
be available to you. When you click it, the status of the experiment will change
to show you both that it is queued for running and that it is completed.
The image below shows playback results from a completed experiment.

Once your experiment is finished, you can use the Play button to plot all the
recorded variables that have been simulated.

If you want to plot a specific variable that you recorded you will be able to do so
using the search bar to look for that variable and using the "Plot" icon. The list
of all the variables recorded in a given experiment is available clicking on the
"Recorded variables" link in the Experiment table.

Clicking on the Results button at the top of the screen will let you rapidly access some
default actions, including the ability to see the cells for which you recorded the membrane
potential spiking!
